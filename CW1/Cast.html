  <p> She snuck into the studio when they were recording and wanted to be part of the film, shes a tabby cat, happy to eat cheese on the daily, always sleeps so were unsure how she snuck into the studios but she did it. Her favourite character is Groot, she likes using him as a scratching post which is the main reason she was kicked out halfway through the film. 10/10 would party with this cat.</p>
